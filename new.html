          <br>On this special Rose Day, I want you to know that you are the most beautiful part of my life. Just like a rose, you bring color, fragrance, and joy to my world. Every petal reminds me of your kindness, every thorn of your strength. <br>

          <br>The red roses reflect my deep love for you, and the white ones symbolize the purity of our bond. In this journey of life, you are the most precious bloom in my garden. Your presence makes everything brighter, warmer, and more meaningful.<br>
          
          <br>Thank you for filling my life with love, laughter, and endless happiness. I cherish every moment with you, just like the sweet fragrance of roses that lingers forever.<br>
          
          Happy Rose Day, Sona! üåπ‚ù§Ô∏è
